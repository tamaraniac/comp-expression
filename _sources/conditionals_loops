=======================================
Chapter 5: Conditionals and Loops
=======================================

In the previous chapters, you have explored how to map from Snap code into Processing, Python, and HTML code.  The idea is to make sense of textual programming language based on what you know from Snap.

In this chapter, we reverse the process. We are going to start with two key ideas in programming languages (textual or block-based): Conditionals and loops
Section 1: Conditionals
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Conditionals are also known as if clauses and we use them all the time to express that one thing depends on something else. This idea transfers to programming! 

Let's start with the "if" statement. If you ask someone how their day is, your answer depends on their response. You wouldn't say "Yay!" if someone told you that they had a bad day (hopefully). You would only say "Yay!" if someone says they are "Good."

Then there is the "else if" statement. Let's say you checked for "Good," but did not find it. Give yourself another option! Check for "Bad," which you could answer with something positive (e.g. "Oh no, at least we beat OSU in hockey"). 

Finally, there is the "else" clause. You check and the answer is not "Good" or "Bad," so you make a "catch-all" answer for any other response. 


The Snap Version
--------------------

Here is a `project <https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?username=chloeejnguyen&projectname=example1>`_ that shows the logic from above.

The Processing Version
--------------------

The below program does the same thing in Processing.  

.. activecode:: Processing1

   <html>
       <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.4.1/lib/p5.js"></script>
   <body>
   <script>
      
      // problem with : import import javax.swing.*; (library might be too big to paste on bottom?)
      void setup() {
        size(480, 360);
      }

      void draw() {
        background(255,255,255);
        String answer = getString("Hello! How are you?");

        if(answer.equals("Good"))
        {
          println("Yay!");
        }
        else if(answer.equals("Bad"))
        {
              println("Oh no, at least we beat OSU in hockey :)");
        }
        else
        {
          println("I do not know how to respond to that.");
        }

        noLoop();
      }

      int getInt(String s)
      {
         return Integer.parseInt(getString(s));
      }

      String getString(String s)
      {
         return prompt(s);
      }

      String prompt(String s)
      {
         println(s);
         String entry = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(s);
         if (entry == null)
            return null;
         println(entry);
         return entry;
      }

      // Below this is the code to make turtles work in P5.js
      
    </script>
   </body>

   </html>

Let's look at this syntax. The first if statment is checking to see if the word "Good' is in the answer, which was input from the user. "The else if statement checks for "Bad" in the answer as long as "Good" was not found. Finally, "else" tells the user that the computer has no idea how to respond to what the user inputted.

Another Example
--------------------
Do you know when you sign up for a new account and have to enter your birthday? Some websites have you put a number for your month, others give you a drop down menu, and still others show a calender. Here is a simple `Snap project <https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?username=chloeejnguyen&projectname=example2>`_ that takes in a number and gives your birth month. Note that instead of an "else if" statement, Snap just has you put an if statement inside of another one. It works the same way! The first if statement is checked before the second one, the second before the third, and so on.

The below program does the same thing in Processing.

Try answering these questions about the Processing code above.

.. mchoice:: ProIf1
    :correct: c
    :answer_a: February
    :answer_b: I do not know how to respond to that.
    :answer_c: That is not a valid month.
    :answer_d: December
    :feedback_a: No, February only outputs if number is equal to 2.
    :feedback_b: No, there is not a print out statement with that phrase anywhere in the code.
    :feedback_c: Yes, exactly right.
    :feedback_d: No, that is the "catch-all" statement, but an if statement is satisfied before the computer gets to else.

     What is outputted if the input is "14"?

.. mchoice:: ProIf2
    :correct: d
    :answer_a: No reason, order doesn't matter.
    :answer_b: If they did not check that the input was an number between 1-12, December would be outputted even when input is "-1".
    :answer_c: There would be no point checking what month the input corresponded to if the input was not a number between 1-12.
    :answer_d: Both B and C.
    :feedback_a: No, think about time. Would it be faster to go through 12 lines of code or just 1?
    :feedback_b: Yes, kind of right. What else is right?
    :feedback_c: Yes, kind of right. What else is right?
    :feedback_d: Yes, exactly right.

     Why do you think the programmer checked that it was a valid month first?


.. mchoice:: ProIf3
    :correct: c
    :answer_a: It would have to check if that day was possible for that month. 
    :answer_b: It would have to check if that day was possible for that month for that year. 
    :answer_c: All of the above.
    :feedback_a: Yes. Only 28 days in February, but 31 in March.
    :feedback_b: Yes. Leap year! Now there are 29 days in February.
    :feedback_c: Yes, exactly right.

     How would this program change if you were doing days?

Section 2: Loops
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Loops are exactly what they sound like, doing the same thing again and again. There are several different types of loops, but we are going to focus on the for loop. A for loop is used when you know how many times you have to do something. 

For example, imagine making a circle in Snap. You would move a few steps forward and then turn. And then repeat that a bunch of times. Let's say you turned 1 degree every time, you would repeat the process 360 times to get a circle!


The Snap Version
--------------------
.. image:: ADD_IN

Here is a `project <https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?username=chloeejnguyen&projectname=example3>`_ that takes in a word from the user and makes a right triangle out of the letters!

The Processing Version
--------------------

Let's start with a simplified version in Processing.

.. activecode:: Processing3
   :language: html
   :nocodelens:

   <html>
       <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.4.1/lib/p5.js"></script>
   <body>
   <script>
      
      // problem with : import import javax.swing.*; (library might be too big to paste on bottom?)
      void setup() {
        size(480, 360);
      }

      void draw() {
        background(255,255,255);

        String answer = getString("Enter a word: ");
        int length = answer.length();


        for(int i = 0; i < length; i++)
        {
          print(answer.charAt(i));
        }


        noLoop();
      }

      int getInt(String s)
      {
         return Integer.parseInt(getString(s));
      }

      String getString(String s)
      {
         return prompt(s);
      }

      String prompt(String s)
      {
         println(s);
         String entry = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(s);
         if (entry == null)
            return null;
         println(entry);
         return entry;
      }  
    </script>
   </body>

   </html>

Now this code does not do the exact same thing yet. Let's walk through it
  - takes in a word from the user, e.g. apple
  - finds the length of the word, e.g. 5
  - makes a for loop that runs 5 times
  - outputs answer.ChartAt(i)

How do we know that we loop around 5 times? The line "for(int i = 0; i < length; i++)" creates a for loop that goes around "length" number of times doing whatever is after the colon. We start with that variable i equal to 0 and print something out. The next time around, i = 1 and something is printed out (and so on). The i++ means to increment (or add) 1 to the variable i at the end of each loop.

If the word is apple, length is equal to 5. The for loop goes until the value of i is equal to or greater to length (i < length). With that logic, the loop STOPS when i goes to 5. That means it outputs something for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Or, in other words, goes around 5 times.

What are we outputting? The variable "answer" is the word that the user gave us. The phrase "answer.ChartAt(i)" gives us a letter (character) from the word. If i = 0, it would be 'a.' If i = 1, it would be 'p.' If i = 2, it would be 'p.' If i = 3, it would be 'l.' If i = 4, it would be 'e.'

Try answering this question about the Processing code above.

.. mchoice:: ProFor
    :correct: c
    :answer_a: Yes, "applee."
    :answer_b: Yes, "applea."
    :answer_c: No.
    :feedback_a: No, the word apple does not have a sixth letter so answer.ChartAt(5) would give an error!
    :feedback_b: No, the word apple does not have a sixth letter so answer.ChartAt(5) would give an error!
    :feedback_c: Yes, exactly right.

     If the word is apple, would a for loop that has i < 6 work? If so, what would the output be?

Here is the Processing code that matches the Snap project above.

.. activecode:: Processing4
   :language: html
   :nocodelens:

   <html>
       <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.4.1/lib/p5.js"></script>
   <body>
   <script>
      
      // problem with : import import javax.swing.*; (library might be too big to paste on bottom?)
      void setup() {
        size(480, 360);
      }
      void draw() {
        background(255,255,255);

        String answer = getString("Enter a word: ");
        int length = answer.length();


        for(int i = 0; i < length; i++)
        {
         for(int j = 0; j < (i+1); j++)
         {
           print(answer.charAt(i));
         }
         println();
        }


        noLoop();
      }

      int getInt(String s)
      {
         return Integer.parseInt(getString(s));
      }

      String getString(String s)
      {
         return prompt(s);
      }

      String prompt(String s)
      {
         println(s);
         String entry = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(s);
         if (entry == null)
            return null;
         println(entry);
         return entry;
      } 
    </script>
   </body>

   </html>

Now there are two for loops and we have our right triangle. Here a few hints about how this works:    
  - once the first for loop is entered, the second for loop is entered and runs COMPLETELY (j = 1, j = 2, j = 3,...) before the first for loop "loops"
  - i changes every time! that means the number of times the second for loop "loops" also changes every time
    - when i = 0, j runs once
    - when i = 1, j runs twice


 Try answering these questions about the Python code above.

.. mchoice:: ProFor1
    :correct: b
    :answer_a: 5 times
    :answer_b: 6 times
    :answer_c: 3 times
    :feedback_a: No, what is the range?
    :feedback_b: No, what is the range?
    :feedback_c: Yes, exactly right. i + 1 = 3

     If i = 2, how many times will the second for loop "loop"?

     .. mchoice:: ProFor2
    :correct: a
    :answer_a: a
               p p 
               l l l
    :answer_b: 6 a
                 p p 
    :answer_c: a
               p p 
               l e
    :feedback_a: Yes, exactly right.
    :feedback_b: No. Remember we start with i = 0 so the first for loop is finishing it's third iteration.
    :feedback_c: No. Think about answer.ChartAt(i). The second for loop just outputs the same letter (answer.ChartAt(i)), j (i+1) number of times.

     Let's say the word is apple. If we pause the program after the first for loop is finished a third time (i equals 2 and is about to equal 3), what does the output look like?


.. mchoice:: ProFor3
    :correct: a
    :answer_a: Prints new line, first for loop.
    :answer_b: Prints new line, second for loop.
    :answer_c: Prints space, first for loop.
    :answer_d: Prints space, second for loop.
    :feedback_a: Yes, exactly right.
    :feedback_b: No, think about where it is indented.
    :feedback_c: No, think about when a space is needed. After we change to the next letter in the word or after a letter is repeated?
    :feedback_d: No, think about where it is indented.

     What do you think print() does? And what for loop does it belong to?

.. mchoice:: ProFor4
    :correct: c
    :answer_a: answer.ChartAt(length-i) 
    :answer_b: answer.ChartAt(i+j)
    :answer_c: answer.ChartAt((length-1)-i)
    :feedback_a: No. When i=0, we are left with answer.ChartAt(length). For apple, answer.ChartAt(5) does not exist, as answer.ChartAt(0) is 'a' and answer.ChartAt(4) is 'e'.
    :feedback_b: No. The value of j changes, so there would be different letters on the same line.
    :feedback_c: Yes, exactly right. 

     If you wanted to make a right triangle of the word's letters in BACKWARD order, what would you replace "print(answer.charAt(i))" with?

Circle Example
--------------------
Let's do something more visual. Here is a `project <https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?username=chloeejnguyen&projectname=example4>`_ that draws a numer of circles onto a screen based on user input.

.. mchoice:: ProFor4
    :correct: c
    :answer_a: 0, <, --
    :answer_b: 0, >, ++
    :answer_c: 0, <, ++
    :feedback_a: No. If i = 0 at the start, then -- would make it decrement (-1) every time and it would always be less than answer.
    :feedback_b: No. If i = 0 at the start, it will never loop because 0 > a positive number (answer) is not true.
    :feedback_c: Yes, exactly right. 

     If you wanted to do the same thing in processing and the variable answer is the positive number from the user, fill in the for loop (where one loop means one circle).
     for(int i = _; i __ answer; i__){
         circle(i*10,180,100);
         noFill();
     }
     
One of the answer options showed a -- instead of ++. This means instead of i going from 0 to 1 and 1 to 2, it would go from 0 to -1 and 0 to -2. But i doesn't always have to equal 0 in the begininning!

.. mchoice:: ProFor4
    :correct: b
    :answer_a: answer, <, --
    :answer_b: answer, >, --
    :answer_c: answer, <, ++
    :feedback_a: No. If i = answer at the start, it will never loop because a positive number (answer) > 0 is not true.
    :feedback_b: Yes, exactly right.
    :feedback_c: No. If i = answer at the start, it will always be greater than 0 unless one decrements (-1) instead of increments (+1);

     If you wanted to do the same thing in processing and the variable answer is the positive number from the user, fill in the for loop (where one loop means one circle).
     for(int i = _; i __ 0; i__){
         circle(i*10,180,100);
         noFill();
     }

Star Grid Example
--------------------
In the triangle example, there were two for loops, one inside the other. That is called nested for loops and very helpful when drawing something in the 2D space.  Here is a `project <https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?username=chloeejnguyen&projectname=example5>`_ that fills the space with evenly spaced stars. It starts with the top row going completely through all the columnds, then moves down to the second row and goes through all the columns. Instead of figuring out how many stars fit in a row (and how many rows there are) and making two for loop, two while loops used. While loops are loops that continue doing whatever action is inside of them UNTIL a condition is met.

.. mchoice:: ProFor4
    :correct: a
    :answer_a: reaches right side of screen
    :answer_b: reaches left side of screen
    :answer_c: never
    :feedback_a: Yes, exactly right.
    :feedback_b: No. We start at the top left corner!
    :feedback_c: No. That would be an infinite loop!

     The second while loop is supposed to stamp a star, move to the right, and stamp a star. When should it stop moving to the right?
     
     If the size of the screen is 480 in the x direction, it would look like "while(x < 480)."

    :feedback_a: No. Look at the beginning of draw, where do we start x and y?
    :feedback_b: Yes, exactly right. You have to reset x!
    :feedback_c: No. Y has already been set to its next position!

     The code above is missing something important for it to work. What is it?

Here is the complete Processing code. Notice how the y position is changed in the first while loop and the x position is reset, while the second while loop moves the x position to the right and does nothing to the y.
